Proposing the GRT: Genesee River Transit
An efficient, cost-effective, modern & beautiful transit system that connects Rochester with a strong north/south backbone along the Genesee River, finally enabling RIT and U of R students to live and engage with our historic downtown. A remarkably achievable project that utilizes two unique yet functional forms of transportation tailor-made for our unique geography: water taxis along the Genesee with a gondola lift to bypass the waterfalls.

The airport, RIT, U of R, the Blue Cross Arena, Seneca Park Zoo, Genesee Brew House, Strong Museum, Strong Hospital; what do these places have in common? They all rest on or near the banks of the Genesee River. A successful implementation of the GRT would connect the most important institutions and restore urban vibrancy to Rochester by making the heart of the city more accessible to young professionals and future denizens.


The main question I’ve faced when researching this proposal is “why isn’t this already implemented?” Is there some fatal flaw that I’m missing? The unit economics make sense and my experience driving for Uber proves that the demand is there. Barely no new infrastructure would need to be built when compared with a light rail system. What’s the downside? As far as my research goes, there really isn’t one.


Phase 1:
The beautiful thing about the Genesee River is that it’s already there. It’s an average of 200 feet across and 13 feet deep—plenty of space for bidirectional transit.
That means that this plan is completely modular, and capable of being scaled up to service 10,000 rides per day. For reference, RTS serves 21k rides per day.
At 25 knots service speed, a boat can go from RIT to High Falls in less than 20 minutes (without stops).
A full version of this plan could include 7 stops, bringing the end-to-end time for non-express ferries up to 45 minutes with a maximum wait time of six minutes. That’s on par with most major metro rail systems.






Phase 2:
A gondola lift to connect the 2.5 mile stretch from high falls to low falls to ridge road at the veterans memorial bridge.

For context, Paris is building a similar length cable car system that is budgeted at $145 million. Not a small sum, but within the realm of possibility? Kansas City Streetcar


Phase 3:
Ridge rd to Charlotte by boats.
