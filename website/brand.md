## Voice & Tone

### Principles

1. **Confident, Not Arrogant**
   - We believe in this vision but acknowledge the work ahead
   - "This is achievable" rather than "This will definitely happen"

2. **Informative, Not Academic**
   - Clear explanations accessible to everyone
   - Technical details presented simply

3. **Inspiring, Not Hyperbolic**
   - Let the vision speak for itself
   - Avoid excessive superlatives and buzzwords

4. **Local Pride, Not Parochialism**
   - Celebrate Rochester's unique character
   - Reference familiar landmarks and places

### Writing Guidelines

- Use active voice
- Keep sentences concise
- Lead with benefits, follow with details
- Reference specific Rochester locations and institutions
- Avoid jargon and acronyms without explanation
- Never use "revolutionary," "game-changing," or similar tech-speak

### Sample Messaging

**Instead of:**
> "Our revolutionary transit solution leverages cutting-edge technology to transform the urban mobility landscape."

**Write:**
> "Water taxis on the Genesee can get you from RIT to downtown in 20 minutes—faster than driving at rush hour."
